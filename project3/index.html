    <h1>Centuries of breeding have reshaped dog brains—here’s how</h1>
    <h2>The role for which a dog was bred—say retrieving birds—is reflected in their brain structure, according to a study of 33 breeds.</h2>
    <p>     There are hundreds of dog breeds around the world, from the teensy chihuahua to the massive Saint Bernard—all thanks to centuries of selective breeding by humans. With such a wide range of canine sizes and temperaments, it’s no surprise that, in the process, we have reshaped their brains as well as their bodies.</p>
    <p2>    A new study performed MRI scans on 33 breeds and discovered how a dog was bred is reflected in their brain structure. (Read “How to build a dog” in National Geographic magazine.)</p2>
    <p3>    For instance, dogs bred to be small—say the lhasa apso—have round heads with similarly round brains that take up most of their skull. A larger breed like a golden retriever has a long, narrow head, and thus a more elongated brain that doesn't fill all of the skull space.
